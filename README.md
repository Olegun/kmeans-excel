K-means clustering is usefull for Data Mining and Business Intelligence.

K-means does not need to know the qualities of the data, just the number of clusters (groups) that need to be created.
The output is a number indicating which group each record belongs to.

This example is k-means clustering implemented in EXCEL VBA.
Please provide your raw data and the initial centroids figures, and click "Perform k-means"
The program will stop execution when the clusters are normalized or when the maximum iterations are reached. (Whichever comes first)
This Excel file contains an example data set representing the GPS coordinates of McDonald's restaurants in Europe.
