# k-means-excel

This is a clustering algorithm implemented in EXCEL VBA
The user has to provide the raw data and the initial centroids

The VBA script is presented in the blog:

However it was not executing and needed some corrections.
I am planning to improve the code and the presentation on the Excel file
